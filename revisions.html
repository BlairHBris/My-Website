        <h2>Site Revisions</h2>
        <p>
            The first person I asked to review my website was my wife. 
            As a CPA, she has a great depth of experience 
            with document and site portal layouts. This was part of my 
            original budget building page:
        </p>
        <img id="ACR" src="images/autoclickrevision1.PNG" alt="Pre-revision">
        <p>
            She identified two issues:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Without a header, the tab bar was not distinguished enough
                    from the introductory paragraph.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Having all of the tabs closed when the page was first loaded 
                    didn't show her how the tabs worked. Instead she had to 
                    figure it out herself and if she was just scrolling she 
                    could easily miss the tab bar in its entirety.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            I then took her suggestions and edited the page to have a header 
            and to have the Account Summary tab open on page load.
