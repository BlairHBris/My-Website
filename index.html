        <p>
            Being born and raised in Annapolis Maryland, there are a couple of things that have always been a large part of my life;
            water sports, the Naval Academy, and the Baltimore Ravens. Although I've been away from home for over half a decade
            ,due to attending Clemson University and moving to Tampa, my passion for those three things strong remain and never
            miss a chance to go home for a Ravens game.
            Currently, I work at Ford Motor Credit Company as a Team Leader in the Titles department. My past positions include 
            customer service representative, a vehicle loan officer, and a dealership credit analyst!
            I am always looking ahead for my next opportunity; maybe it's the Tampa sunset, but the horizon always looks nice here!

            I want to be a Software Engineer because I love to solve problems and make life optimizations using technology. I
            have always had a love for computers, admittedly starting with video games in middle school, As I matured and 
            advanced from school to my professional career, I began to realize just how much easier things can be  with a little
            technological assistance. Homework assignments can go from hours of work to a few minutes, work report tracking can be done
            automatically, and interfaces can be created that make even the most complicated database or idea easy to interact with.
        </p>
        <p>
            Computers are the most powerful creation and the most problem solving tools in the world. Having this opportunity to work with
            them in a full time role where I can improve processes that affect countless numbers of people is a dream come true.
            I can't wait to meet this new horizon head on!
