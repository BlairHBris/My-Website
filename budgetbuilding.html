            I love personal finance. I spend a lot of my evenings tracking the 
            balances of the various accounts my wife and I have. I track deposits, 
            withdrawals, growth, and depreciation. It’s calming to me. Having full 
            knowledge of our personal finances gives me a great sense of control and 
            stability and the best way for me to do that is to keep a budget and expense 
            tracker for every month.
        </p>
        <p>
            This may sound like a daunting task and indeed, tracking all this by 
            hand would be an error filled, tedious, and frustrating mess. However, 
            with the power of computers, and a little set up, this knowledge is 
            easy to reach and, if you’re like me, so is the peace of mind that comes with it.

            The first step is picking your program of choice. I recommend and 
            will be using Google Sheets for this walkthrough; its availability 
            as an app and price of $0 are hard to beat. After you make this 
            selection, you need to start thinking creatively. A budget may 
            indeed be primarily made of numbers, but the presentation and 
            structure of your sheet makes the difference between a useful tool 
            and a listless thing that causes more pain than its worth.
        </p>
        <p>
            So this begs the question, how do you create and structure a fully
            functional budget sheet?
            In my budget sheet there are 3 sections, The Account Tracker, The 
            Budget, and The Expense List. Click on the tabs below to learn more!

        <h3>The Creation Process</h3>
        <div class="tab">
            <button class="tablinks" 
            onclick="openSection(event, 'Account Summary')"
            id="defaultTab">
                Account Summary
            </button>
            <button class="tablinks" 
            onclick="openSection(event,'Budget')">
                Budget
            </button>
            <button class="tablinks" 
            onclick="openSection(event,'Funds Tracker')">
                Funds Tracker
            </button>
            <button class="tablinks" 
            onclick="openSection(event,'Putting Everything Together')">
                Putting Everything Together
            </button>
	    </div>

        
        <div id="Account Summary" class="tabcontent">
            <span onclick="this.parentElement.style.display='none'" 
            class="closeoutTopRight">X</span>
            <h3>The Account Summary</h3>
            <img id="excel" src="images/accountsummary1.PNG" alt="First Account Summary Screen">
            <p>
                Your Account Summary should be formatted as a table with 4 columns, 
                Account, BOM (Beginning of Month), EOM (End of Month), and Change. 
                In this example we have 3 different accounts with some filler values 
                for BOM and a formula in the Change column that subtracts EOM from BOM. 
                I have also added a Total row at the bottom which is a SUM() formula for 
                each column.
            </p>
            <p>
                For now, BOM will remain empty. We will come back to this 
                in a later tab. As you can see I also added light formatting by making 
                all cells that contain numbers into dollar values which I will continue to do.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="Budget" class="tabcontent">
            <span onclick="this.parentElement.style.display='none'" 
            class="closeoutTopRight">X</span>
            <h3>The Budget</h3>
            <img id="excelbudget" src="images/budget1.PNG" alt="First Budget">
            <p>
                Your first step to making a budget is putting down the amount of money you 
                expect to bring in each month. Whether this is consistent or not, I 
                recommend starting with the amount brought in last month for ease of use.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, we will list out our expenses and their amounts. These amounts can 
                either be fixed, such as monthly rent or mortgage, or they can be variable, 
                like grocery spending. You can have as many or as few categories as you 
                would like. I have 8 in this example as you can see on the right, but this 
                guide will work no matter how many categories you have.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tip: Enter your amount estimates as negative numbers so that your 
                    remainder calculation is just a SUM() formula for the whole column.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div id="Funds Tracker" class="tabcontent">
            <span onclick="this.parentElement.style.display='none'" 
            class="closeoutTopRight">X</span>
            <h3>The Funds Tracker</h3>
            <p>
                This is the heart of the budget sheet, where you put in all the money you 
                bring in and all of the money you spend each month. To do this I recommend 
                using a two table structure, one for cash inflows and one for outflows. 
                In this example below, you can see each table has four columns:
                <ul>
                    <li>Date</li>
                    <li>Amount</li>
                    <li>Categoty</li>
                    <li>Account</li>
                </ul>
                <img id="excelFT" src="images/fundtracker1.PNG" alt="First Funds Tracker">
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="Putting Everything Together" class="tabcontent">
            <span onclick="this.parentElement.style.display='none'" 
            class="closeoutTopRight">X</span>
            <h3>Putting Everything Together</h3>
            <p>
                Now we have a perfectly fine layout, but much like a web page with HTML and 
                no JavaScript, it doesn't really do much. Sure we can fill out the Funds 
                Tracker for the whole month perfectly, but our Account Summary wouldn’t 
                be altered and we would have no idea if we kept to our budget. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To make this a working sheet, we need to add formulas to the Account 
                Summary and Budget sections. On the face of it, you may think that 
                since the Budget section has 8 categories and the Account Summary has 
                3 sections that we will need to make 11 formulas. However, thanks to 
                the power of computers we only need 3!
            </p>
            <p>
                A quick note before we dive in, Google Sheets is cell-based for it’s 
                formulas so if your sheet does not look exactly like the example then 
                you may have to adjust your cell identifiers.
            </p>
            <h3>Formula for the Account Summary</h3>
            <p>
                For the account summary, we need a formula that can tell when we take 
                money out or add money to an account based on the Funds Tracker to fill 
                in the EOM column. I have added the below transactions to the Funds tracker.
            </p>
            <img id="excelFT" src="images/fundtracker2.PNG" alt="Second Funds Tracker">
            <p>
                The main element of our formula will be SUMIF(). To learn the ins and out of 
                this formula, follow this 
                <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093583?hl=en">LINK,</a>
                but since this is a budget tutorial, 
                not a Google Sheets one, you can copy and paste the following into the 
                EOM-Checking cell:
                <br>
                <br>
                G2+ sumif($I$10:$I$1000,F2, $G$10:$G$1000)- sumif($N$10:$N$1000,F2, $L$10:$L$1000)
            </p>
            <p>
                Then, since the formula uses 
                <a href="https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/googlespreadsheets/types-of-cell-references/1/">
                    ABSOLUTE REFERENCES</a>
                we can then just drag it down into the two remaining cells. 
                If all goes well this should be your result!
            </p>
            <img id="excelFT" src="images/result1.PNG" alt="Test your Result">
            <h3>Formula for the Budget</h3>
            <p>
                This formula is just a slight modification of the one from before. 
                All we need to do is remove the first cell reference and then shift from 
                looking at the account the transaction would affect to looking at the 
                category. Paste this formula into cell C1:
                <br>
                <br>
                sumif($H$10:$H$1000,A1, $G$10:$G$1000)-sumif($M$10:$M$1000,A1, $L$10:$L$1000)
            </p>
            <p>
                Then dragging down should give you this result when you also drag 
                over the remainder formula!
            </p>
            <img id="excelB2" src="images/budget2.PNG" alt="Second Budget">
            <p>
                The Investment category will be an exception because it is also an account. 
                Use this formula for cell C12 and then your final result will now be 
                correct!
                <br>
                <br>
                =-sumif($H$10:$H$1000,A12, $G$10:$G$1000)
            </p>
            <span onclick="this.parentElement.style.display='none'" 
            class="closeoutBottomRight">X</span>

        <h2>Final Result</h2>
        <p>
            Congratulations! You created a completely working budget sheet. 
            Or you skipped the tabs and clicked 
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nxzEJxTfQwSNxi5lI7ugbT6EaZr9BV6LeuHXAHopY_A/edit?usp=sharing" download>
                HERE</a> 
            to download it. 
            Either way I’m proud of you because you’ve taken the first step 
            on the road to understanding your personal finances. And now we 
            get to have some fun with it, let’s start styling!

        <h2>The Styling Process</h2>
        <img id="style" src="images/style.png" alt="Paint Pallette">
        <p>
            When you consider creative styling and a budget sheet, they may sound 
            contradictory. However, instead of thinking of creativity like painting, 
            think of it as optimization. My goal with styling is to make the sheet 
            streamlined and user friendly so that a novice could understand it. 
            A document can consist of an untold number of elements, but with creative 
            styling focused around optimization, it should be very easy to read, 
            understand, and utilize.
        </p>
        <hr>

        <h3>Styling Steps</h3>
        <div class="tab">
            <button class="tablinks" 
            onclick="openSection(event, 'Define Priorities')"
            id="defaultTab">
                Define Priorities

            <button class="tablinks" 
            onclick="openSection(event,'Showing Primary')">
                Showing Primary
            </button>
            <button class="tablinks" 
            onclick="openSection(event,'Make it Intuitive')">
                Make it Intuitive
            </button>
            <button class="tablinks" 
            onclick="openSection(event,'Showing Secondary')">
                Showing Secondary
            </button>
	    </div>

        <div id="Define Priorities" class="tabcontent">
            <span onclick="this.parentElement.style.display='none'" 
            class="closeoutTopRight">X</span>
            <h3>Define Your Priorities</h3>
            <img id="priority" src="images/priorities.jfif" alt="Priorities List">
            <p>
                My first step when I’m styling is to identify which elements are the 
                most important for myself or whoever I am making the sheet for. In our 
                example we built a sheet with 3 sections and undoubtedly the end client 
                has a ranking of importance for them. Determining that order of 
                importance is key to properly direct the creative process.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="Showing Primary" class="tabcontent">
            <span onclick="this.parentElement.style.display='none'" 
            class="closeoutTopRight">X</span>
            <h3>Showing Primary</h3>
            <p>
                From this point a lot of the creation process is up to preference. We 
                now know the order of importance so we just need to determine how the 
                end client sees style methods. Maybe highlights are seen as the strongest 
                identifier, or they could be seen as too distracting. Personally, I like 
                highlighting cells and the most important thing to me is if change in each 
                of my accounts is positive or negative each month, so we will use  
                <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/78413?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop">CONDITIONAL FORMATTING</a> to accomplish that. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="Make it Intuitive" class="tabcontent">
            <span onclick="this.parentElement.style.display='none'" 
            class="closeoutTopRight">X</span>
            <h3>Make it Intuitive</h3>
            <p>
                This is where <a href="https://cxl.com/blog/intuitive-web-design-how-to-make-your-website-intuitive-to-use/#:~:text=Intuitive%20design%20means%20that%20when,know%20exactly%20what%20to%20do.&text=Design%20is%20intuitive%20when%20users,intuitive%20design%20focuses%20on%20experience.">
                INTUITIVE DESIGN</a> needs to be considered. I could make a positive change
                be purple and a negative change be gold but that's unnecessarily confusing
                to a third party. Even when creating something just for yourself, I recommend
                using intuitive design and existing conventions because it is both good practice
                and easier to understand, even if subconsciously.
                <img id="ACR1" src="images/accountsummary2.PNG" alt="Highlighted Account Values">

        <div id="Showing Secondary" class="tabcontent">

            <h3>Showing Secondary</h3>
            <p>
                <img id="ACR" src="images/budget4.PNG" alt="Colored Budget Values">
                My second priority is seeing if I kept within each budget category. 
                SInce this is of a lower importance, I do not want to use the same style, 
                highlights, as I did for the Account Summary so instead I will be using 
                text color. From an artistic perspective we could choose any color once 
                again, however that would just add another new element for the user to 
                understand. In my creations I appreciate simplicity and consistency; 
                since we are doing the same thing here as before, checking if one number 
                is greater or less than another, I believe we should use the same green 
                and red color scheme. In this case green would represent that we have 
                spent less than we budgeted and red would represent that we spent more.
            </p>
            <p>
                This makes our sheet easy to read while increasing its utility. At a 
                glance anyone can now see our Budget and Account Summary status and since 
                they both use the same color rule there is little chance of a 
                communication failure.

            Finally we get to the Funds Tracker. Although this is very important 
            for the budget sheet to function, I don’t really like or see value in looking at 
            individual transactions so anything that draws the eye wouldn’t be a good idea.  
            Therfore, I will be leaving that section as is. See the completed form

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            As I stated at the beginning, the goal of my creative process is 
            ultimately to make a fully functional tool as easy to use and understand 
            as possible. When designing for someone else I take their preferences and 
            importance rankings into account instead of my own but that central goal 
            remains unchanged.

            The true artistry, in my opinion, is taking something complicated and 
            making it usable through easy-to-understand styling and interactive 
            elements. On this budget sheet we created together, all our end user has 
            to do is enter their fund transactions in the premade table and they will 
            then be given full knowledge of their personal finances at any time. For 
            someone like me who lives for personal finance, having made something with 
            that much power and potential to help people is truly special.
